<h1>Apply filters to SQL queries</h1>


<h2>Project description</h2>
For this project I played the part of a Cybersecurity Analyst working for an organization. It was my job to examine logs in a timely fashion using SQL queries to filter log data for user logins.<br/><br/>

<h2>Retrieve after hours failed login attempts</h2>
I was charged to investigate a potential security incident that occurred after 18:00 which is after normal business hours. The following code demonstrates how I filtered failed logon attempts after normal business hours using a SQL query.</br></br>
